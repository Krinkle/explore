QUnit is a JavaScript testing framework. Its philosophy is centred around being easy-to-use, universally runnable, and highly extensible by developers through plugins.

The framework was originally developed in 2008 by John Resig, for use by jQuery. It has been been rewriten and maintained as an independent project, now hosted by the OpenJS Foundation.

QUnit interface influenced the CommonJS Unit Testing specification, since implemented by Node.js, and other systems.
